## Reflection
This investigation showed that persona-based AI simulation can effectively approximate realistic user feedback in early design phases. The TinyTroupe framework allowed exploration of multiple perspectives quickly without external participants. While mock mode responses are simplified, the structure and tone align with real usability feedback—demonstrating promise for low-cost, rapid UX evaluation workflows in future product iterations.
