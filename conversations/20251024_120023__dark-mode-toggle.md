[MOCK] Persona Busy Parent (Time-pressed casual user) feedback on Dark Mode toggle:
- Reaction: Convenient for frequent sharers; minimal taps is good.
- Usability: Ensure 44x44pt targets, clear label, and undo after share.
- Accessibility: VoiceOver should announce 'Quick Share button'; respect Dynamic Type; high contrast.
- Privacy: No background uploads; clarify data use; allow opt-out in Settings.
- Adoption: 78/100 if non-intrusive and fast; improve with tooltip on first launch, then stay quiet.
- Follow-ups: 1) Does it respect system text size? 2) Can users disable or reorder share options?
