[MOCK] Persona Tech-savvy Gen-Z Power User feedback on New 'Quick Share' button on iOS detail screen:
- Reaction: Convenient for frequent sharers; minimal taps is good.
- Usability: Ensure 44x44pt targets, clear label, and undo after share.
- Accessibility: VoiceOver should announce 'Quick Share button'; respect Dynamic Type; high contrast.
- Privacy: No background uploads; clarify data use; allow opt-out in Settings.
- Adoption: 78/100 if non-intrusive and fast; improve with tooltip on first launch, then stay quiet.
